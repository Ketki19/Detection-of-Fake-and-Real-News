# Detection-of-Fake-and-Real-News

## Problem Statement:
To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. 
Using sklearn, build a TfidfVectorizer on the provided dataset. Then, initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

### In the News folder, there are three file:
* news.zip : Zipped dataset called news.csv
* News_Fake_Real.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook which contains the Python code
* finalized_model.sav : File in which the model is saved
